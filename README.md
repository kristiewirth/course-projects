### [Regression Case Study](regression-case-study/)

##### Project Goals

"The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of
heavy equipment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and
configuration.  The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes
information on usage and equipment configurations."

### [Churn Case Study](churn-case-study/)

##### Project Goals

"A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have provided a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). In other words, a user is "active" if they have taken a trip since June 1, 2014. ... We would like you to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Company X. Therefore, your task is not only to build a model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows you to interpret the factors that contributed to your predictions."

##### Technologies Used
